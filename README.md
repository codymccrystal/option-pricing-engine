# option-pricing-engine

The goals of completing this project can be summarised as follows:
- Further develop programming skills in Python and C++
- Further my understanding of software engineering and full stack development, including designing a frontend to present my option pricing model in a neat and compact format on the web, and using REST API to connect the two.
- Apply financial algorithms to code and integrate a lot of the knowledge I've collected in financial mathematics, in this context being option pricing - both when a closed-form solution is permitted (via the BS Formula) and when one doesn't exist (using FDM and MC methods).
- Commit and push changes on GitHub using Git for version control and continuous integration.

For some extra information about myself...
- Originally studied Sport & Exercise Science (BSc) but preferred the statistics side;
- Achieved highest grade in class in Finance MSc course; writing a thesis in financial econometrics and portfolio optimisation techniques/financial risk management.
- Decided that although, I'd quickly learn finance and dived into a bit of the quantitative side, I still had a lot more I wanted to learn before pursing a job in the field.
- Diverted my time and attention towards studying quantitative finance before committing to the job market - developing skills in fundamental mathematics (Real analysis, algebra, linear algebra, probability theory, stochastic calculus), programming (R, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and some software engineering (through resources, such as Daniel Duffy's applied financial engineering books).
- 8 months later, I've learnt a lot and have a better understanding of where I want to take my career.
- Implementing and documenting some full-scale projects that I've thought of, incorporating many of the techniques I had learnt and putting it all together in a fullstack framework.


I hope that this project is a good first project and furthers my skills and consolidates some information, hopefully generating some insights that I haven't had before.
